# Storage API

Magda service to store/retrieve files.

The service stores files to a [MinIO](https://min.io/) server in a specified MinIO bucket.

## Running

[The Example Config](./config.example.json) should give an idea on the structure of the
expected config file. Create a `config.json` file with the appropriate parameters.

```json5
// Example Config
{
    listenPort: 6121,
    minioAccessKey: "", // You would have specified this when creating the MinIO server
    minioSecretKey: "", // You would have specified this when creating the MinIO server
    minioEnableSSL: true,
    minioHost: "localhost",
    minioPort: 9000,
    tenantId: 0,
    uploadLimit: "100mb"
}
```

If you do not have `yarn` installed, install `yarn` via:

```console
$ sudo npm install yarn -g
$ yarn -v
```

From the `magda-storage-api` directory, run:

```console
$ yarn run dev
Storage API started on port 6121
```
